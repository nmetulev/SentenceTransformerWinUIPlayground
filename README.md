To build and run the project, you will also need to make sure to download the models and vocab files from HuggingFace.

We are currently using these models:

* [Phi3](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-onnx)
* [optimum/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/optimum/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

Place the models in the model directory as illustrated by this screenshot
